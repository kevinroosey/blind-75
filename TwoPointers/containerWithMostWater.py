'''
11. Container With Most Water

Level: Medium

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.


Example 1:
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7].
In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

n == height.length
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= height[i] <= 104

class Solution:
    '''
    Two pointer problem. Create a maxwater variable and iterate all possible combos until l < r
    '''
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
        max_water = 0
        while l < r:
            curr = min(height[l], height[r]) * (r - l)
            max_water = max(max_water, curr)
            if height[l] < height[r]:
                l += 1
            else:
                r-= 1
        return max_water
